Another Portfolio

I have struggled quite a bit with my portfolio. I went from my basic bootcamp portfolio, to an overloaded and bloated one. 
Of course after that I had 3 or so fail in the design stages for not feeling right. Then I decided to go with a minimalist 
approach. After a rushed design session I started on it immediately and decided going with a simple design with nice robust 
animations was the way to go. I'm sure there is room for improvement and would love to hear what others think.

Also this is free to use to anyone struggling with their own portfolio!
